### I'm a Network Administrator in the DC area, who also serves as a reservist for the USAF. Welcome to my portfolio! In the future I have a few goals for this page:
- Showcase labs and trainings that I've worked on while studying for certifications
- Describe my experience gaining IT certs, which study techniques I used, and which skills transfer to my jobs
- Showcase programming and scripting projects that I've completed (once I get to that level)
