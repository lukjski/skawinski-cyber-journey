## How to make $100k annualy in under 4 years
1) Join the military, pick a cyber job (1D7, 1B4, etc). I would suggest 4 year active duty, but 6 years in the Reserves is just as good and this page will be choosing the reserves
2) Go to bootcamp, finish tech school (learn fundamentals, achieve CompTIA Security+), return to station, do AMRT orders for 180 days, finish CDC's and achieve 3 level, go to college (WGU CyberSecurity degree, pick A+, Network+, Cloud+ as the first certs)
3) After AMRT orders end, get a civilian job at Westover at the CFP, do 1 year, apply for the Network (SCOI) shop, work here 1-2 years
4) After achieving Security+, A+, Network+, Azure Cloud, and TS/SCI clearance, apply for an Analyst job at a big defense contractor: Leidos, RTX, Boeing, etc. Be willing to relocate to Washington DC.
