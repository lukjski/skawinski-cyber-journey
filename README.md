# Hi there, I'm Lukasz Skawinski! This github page I will be showcasing my cybersecurity side to give you and idea of my capabiltiies.

# About Me

I graduated high school and joined active duty US Air Force. 
Bootcamp: Honor Grad
Tech School: CompTIA Security+
First Duty station: A+, Network+
Second Duty Station: CCNA Routing and Switching, CCNA Security
Went to the guard and joined Raytheon (now RTX) as a cyber security engineer where I did tool deployement and compliance. 
Transferred to a cyber security network enginner role working on firewalls. 
Transferred from the guard to the reserves, started to use more cyber tools, got the Cisco CyberOps cert, Cyber Yankee 2023
Got a job at Eversource Energy as a Cyber Threat Hunter and Incident Response.
Attended SANS Cyber CTF challenge in Washington DC, placed 6th out of 10, key player in the team. 





### I'm a Cyber Security Threat Hunter and Incident Responder for Eversource Energy and a Cyber Analyst for the USAF. The goal of this page is to track my cyber career and provide for transparency for anyone interested in working together. These are my current goals.
- Attend WGU and get enough credits (70) to transfer to SANS
- Finish BA and MA at SANS
- Crosstrain to 1B4 in the USAF
- Build cyber skills through online resources

## How to make $100k annualy in under 4 years
1) Join the military, pick a cyber job (1D7, 1B4, etc). I would suggest 4 year active duty, but 6 years in the Reserves is just as good and this page will be choosing the reserves
2) Go to bootcamp, finish tech school (learn fundamentals, achieve CompTIA Security+), return to station, do AMRT orders for 180 days, finish CDC's and achieve 3 level, go to college (WGU CyberSecurity degree, pick A+, Network+, Cloud+ as the first certs)
3) After AMRT orders end, get a civilian job at Westover at the CFP, do 1 year, apply for the Network (SCOI) shop, work here 1-2 years
4) After achieving Security+, A+, Network+, Azure Cloud, and TS/SCI clearance, apply for an Analyst job at a big defense contractor: Leidos, RTX, Boeing, etc. Be willing to relocate to Washington DC.
